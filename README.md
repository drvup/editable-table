Customizing tables. The perfect way to organise your settings. But you never include this tables in your repository because it's to much work for something like an customizing table, who an admin will maybe consult 2 times a year?

Here is the solution :) 

With this class it's easy to include tables in your PHP project.

Just do the following:

2) With the function getColumnByName you can choose, which columns you will present
